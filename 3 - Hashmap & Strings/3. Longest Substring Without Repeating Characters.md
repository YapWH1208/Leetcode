Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

        max_length = left = 0
        count = {}

        for right, c in enumerate(s):
            if c in count:
                count[c] += 1
            else:
                count[c] = 1
            
            while count[c] > 1:
                count[s[left]] -= 1
                left += 1
            
            max_length = max(max_length, right-left+1)
        
        return max_length
